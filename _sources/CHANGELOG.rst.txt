Changelog
=========

This page shows the release notes for every released version of the package.  

The first entry corresponds always to a future release and gives a glimpse of
what can be found in the development version.

Please, check the project `Milestones <https://github.com/cta-observatory/protopipe/milestones>`__
for a detailed roadmap of the next planned releases.


v0.5.0 (April, 2022)
------------------------

This release will brings huge improvements to the performance of the pipeline 
and the software package.

Some of the changes are related to the improvements in the interface to the DIRAC grid.
Please, consult that for more details about its latest release.

The **performance** of the pipeline has been validated successfully on a Prod5b simulation
for the Alpha configuration at the North site under specific observational settings.
Tests on a similar configuration for the South site are ongoing.
From now on, performance **results** will be showcased at `this <https://gitlab.cta-observatory.org/mperesano/protopipe-results>`__ website.

The **benchmarking** has become a package module (`protopipe.benchmarking`)
and a new `protopipe-BENCHMARK` script has been added to the suite of available commands.

The pipeline makes now use of `ctapipe v0.11.0` and `pyirf v0.5.0`.
For more details, please consult the merged Pull Requests listed below.

Please, remember that *protopipe* and its interface are open-source projects
and anyone can contribute to it.
It is possible to perform full-scale analyses and contribute to the production
of CTA performances for different science cases or perform studies that require big amounts of data.

.. _protopipe_0p4_release:

`0.4.0 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/protopipe/releases/tag/v0.4.0>`__ (Feb 22th, 2021)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
+++++++

This release brings many improvements of which the most relevant are summarised
here depending on their scope within the pipeline workflow.

Performance-wise, ``protopipe`` caught up with the ``EventDisplay`` and ``CTAMARS``
historical pipelines starting from about 500 GeV onwards.
Below this threshold, even if compatible with requirements, the sensitivity
diverges. The cause seems to be a low-energy effect delimited to
the steps before model training.

- All pipeline

  - upgrade to the API of ``ctapipe 0.9.1``
  - documentation also on ``readthedocs`` and link to ``Zenodo``
  - Continuous Integration is now performed on ``GitHub``
  - New benchmarks have been added
  - Reference analysis and benchmarks results have been updated

- Data training

  - calibration benchmarks need only ``ctapipe-stage1-process`` 
  - ``write_dl1`` has become ``data_training``
  - DL1 parameters and (optionally) images are merged in a single file
  - DL1 parameters names as in ``ctapipe`` and they are in degrees (``TelescopeFrame``)
  - scale correction with the effective focal length
  - fixed bugs and wrong behaviors

- Modeling and DL2 production

  - fixed bugs and wrong behaviors
  - Added missing features to get closer to ``CTAMARS``

- DL3

  - the performance step is now based on the `pyirf <https://cta-observatory.github.io/pyirf/>`_ library
  - performance results are stored `here <https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/benchmarks-reference-analysis/wiki/Protopipe_performance_data>`_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

- Released Oct 24, 2019

- 7 pull requests

**Description**

*protopipe* 0.2 now fully supports the stable release of *ctapipe* 0.7.0.

The main improvements involve the calibration process
(high gain selected by default),
the direction reconstruction and new camera-type labels.

Code based on *pywi*/*pywi-cta* libraries, relevant for wavelet-based image
cleaning, has been removed in favor of *ctapipe* or made completely optional
where needed. Wavelet cleaning is still optional but will need those two
libraries to be additionally installed. Tailcut-based cleaning is now faster.

The README has been improved with installation, basic use, and developer instructions.
Dependencies are listed in ``protopipe_environment.yaml`` and have been simplified.

The auxiliary scripts ``merge_tables.py`` and ``merge.sh`` have been added to allow merging of DL1 and DL2 HDF5 tables.

The ``mars_cleaning_1st_pass`` method is now imported from _ctapipe_.
Novel code using the largest cluster of survived pixels
(``number_of_islands`` and ``largest_island`` methods in the
``event_preparer`` module) has been hardcoded in _protopipe_ and will
disappear with the next release of _ctapipe_.

Model estimators now load the camera types directly from the ``analysis .yaml`` configuration file.

**Description**

The ``write_dl1`` and ``write_dl2`` tools can now save an additional file
through the flag ``--save-images`` when applied to a single run.
This file will contain the original and calibrated (after gain selection)
photoelectron images per event.
A new method ``save_fig`` has been introduced in the ``utils`` module,
so that ``model_diagnostic`` can save images also in PNG format.
Additional docstrings and PEP8 formatting have been added throughout the code.
