Building the models
===================

With *protopipe* it is possible to build estimation models for both particle
energy and gamma/hadron classification.
The base classes are defined in the ``protopipe.mva`` module (see :ref:`mva`).

For both cases, building a regressor or a classifier, the script
``protopipe.scripts.build_model.py`` is used.

The following is the help output which shows required arguments and options.

.. code-block::

  usage: protopipe-MODEL [-h] --config_file CONFIG_FILE [--max_events MAX_EVENTS] [--wave | --tail]
                        (--cameras_from_config | --cameras_from_file | --cam_id_list CAM_ID_LIST) [--indir_signal INDIR_SIGNAL]
                        [--indir_background INDIR_BACKGROUND] [--infile_signal INFILE_SIGNAL] [--infile_background INFILE_BACKGROUND]
                        [-o OUTDIR]

  Build model for regression/classification

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --config_file CONFIG_FILE
    --max_events MAX_EVENTS
                          maximum number of events to use
    --wave                if set, use wavelet cleaning
    --tail                if set, use tail cleaning (default), otherwise wavelets
    --cameras_from_config
                          Get cameras configuration file (Priority 1)
    --cameras_from_file   Get cameras from input file (Priority 2)
    --cam_id_list CAM_ID_LIST
                          Select cameras like 'LSTCam CHEC' (Priority 3)
    --indir_signal INDIR_SIGNAL
                          Directory containing the required SIGNAL input file(s) (default: read from config file)
    --indir_background INDIR_BACKGROUND
                          Directory containing the required BACKGROUND input file(s) (default: read from config file)
    --infile_signal INFILE_SIGNAL
                          SIGNAL file (default: read from config file)
    --infile_background INFILE_BACKGROUND
                          BACKGROUND file (default: read from config file)
    -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR

The script takes along its arguments a configuration file which depends on what
type of model needs to be built.

The available choices can be found under ``protopipe.aux.example_config_files``:

* ``AdaBoostRegressor.yaml`` is used to train an energy regressor,
* ``RandomForestRegressor.yaml``  is used to train an energy regressor,
* ``RandomForestClassifier.yaml`` is used to train a gamma/hadron classifier.

Energy regressor
----------------

To build this you will need at least one table with at least the true energy (the target)
and some event characteristics (the features) to reconstruct the energy.
This table is created in the :ref:`data_training` step.

The following is a commented example of the required configuration file
``AdaBoostRegressor.yaml`` with similar options as for ``RandomForestRegressor.yaml``,

g/h classifier
--------------

To build a gamma/hadron classifier you need gamma-ray and proton tables with some
features used to discriminate between gamma and hadrons (electrons are handled later
as a contamination).

.. note::
  An alternative approach - yet to study - could be to train a classifier with gamma
  against a background sample composed of weighted hadrons and weighted electrons.

The following the example provided by the example configuration file ``RandomForestClassifier.yaml``,

.. warning::

  The default settings used are not yet optimised for every case.

  They have been tuned to get reasonable performance and a good agreeement
  between the training/test samples.

  A first optimisation was reached from a step-by-step comparison against the historical pipeline
  CTAMARS.
