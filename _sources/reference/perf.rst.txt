Performance generation (``protopipe.perf``)
===========================================

Introduction
------------

The DL2-to-DL3 step of the *protopipe* pipeline is based on the 
`pyirf <https://cta-observatory.github.io/pyirf/>`_ library.

The ``protopipe.perf`` module contains utility tools used to interface with this
library, mainly to translate the DL2 data in the internal nomenclature used by
*pyirf* to produce the DL3 file.

In general this step takes care of,

* handling the determination of the best-cutoffs to separate gamma and
  the background (protons + electrons),
* estimating the sensitivity from the optimized cuts,
* producing the instrument response functions (IRFs).

Provided that a performance script makes use of 
``protopipe.perf.utils.read_DL2_pyirf``, *protopipe* supports the addition and 
testing of multiple scripts based on pyirf.

.. note::
  Some functions are discontinued or will be with the next release
  and should be removed.

The current approach is based on the *EventDisplay* historical pipeline for which
the following main points apply,

- maximum signal efficiency set to 80%,
- optimisation cuts are performed following these steps,
  - applying a global cut of 40% signal efficiency,
  - energy-bin-wise 68% containment angular cuts optimization 
  - energy-bin-wise optimisation of gamma/hadron separation cut for best sensitivity

For more details on the specific API and benchmarks, please check *pyirf*'s documentation.
