Multivariate analysis (``protopipe.mva``)
=========================================

Introduction
------------

`protopipe.mva` contains utilities to build models for regression and
classification. It is based on machine learning methods available in
scikit-learn_. Internally, the tables are dealt with the Pandas_ Python module.

For each type of camera a regressor/classifier should be trained.

For both type of models an average of the image estimates is computed
during the :ref:`data_training` and/or :ref:`DL2` steps to
determine a global output for the event (energy or score/gammaness).

Details
-------

Data is split in train and test subsamples by single telescope images.

The class ```TrainModel``` uses a training sample composed of 

- signal for a regression model,
- signal and background for a classifier.

In the default analysis workflow, signal is composed of gamma-rays
while background by protons.

The training of a model can be done also via the GridSearchCV_ algorithm which 
allows to find the best hyper-parameters of the models.

Currently tested models:

- ``sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier``
- ``sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor``
- ``sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor``

For details about the generation of each model type, please refer to 
:ref:`model_building`.
