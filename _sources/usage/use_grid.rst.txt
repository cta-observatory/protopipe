Large scale analyses
====================

This page is meant to be also a tutorial on how to perform large scale analyses with *protopipe*.

Requirements
------------

* protopipe (:ref:`install`)
* GRID interface (:ref:`install-grid`),
* be accustomed with the basic pipeline workflow (:ref:`use-pipeline`),
* be accustomed with the scripts provided by *protopipe* (:ref:`Scripts <scripts>`),

  Standard analysis workflow with protopipe.

Usage
-----

Preliminary operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Get a proxy with ``dirac-proxy-init``
2. Choose the simulation production that you want to work on (this is reported e.g. in the CTA wiki)
3. use ``cta-prod-dump-dataset`` to obtain the original lists of simtel files for each particle type
4. use ``protopipe-SPLIT_DATASET`` to split the original lists depending on the chosen analysis workflow

.. warning::

  For the moment, only the standard analysis workflow (stored under ``protopipe_grid_interface/aux``) has been tested.

.. note::

  Make sure you are using a `protopipe-CTADIRAC`-based environment, otherwise you won't
  be able to interface with DIRAC.

  To monitor the jobs you can use the 
  `DIRAC Web Interface <https://ccdcta-web.in2p3.fr/DIRAC/?view=tabs&theme=Crisp&url_state=1|*DIRAC.JobMonitor.classes.JobMonitor:,>`_

Start your analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Setup analysis**

   Use ``protopipe-CREATE_ANALYSIS`` to create a directory tree, depending on your setup.

   The script will store and partially edit for you all available
   configuration files under the ``configs`` folder.
   It will also create an ``analysis_metadata.yaml`` file which will store the
   basic information regarding your analysis on the grid and on your machine.

   .. note::

    To reproduce or access the analysis data of someone else on DIRAC it will be sufficient
    to modify the metadata key ``analyses_directory`` referred to your local path.

2. **Obtain training data for energy estimation**

   1. edit ``grid.yaml`` to use gammas without energy estimation
   2. ``protopipe-SUBMIT_JOBS --analysis_path=[...]/test_analysis --output_type=TRAINING ....``
   3. once the jobs have concluded and the files are ready you can use ``protopipe-DOWNLOAD_AND_MERGE``
   4. use ``protopipe-BENCHMARK`` to check the properties of the data sample you obtained

3. **Build the model for energy estimation**

   1. edit the configuration file of your model of choice
   2. use ``protopipe-MODEL`` with this configuration file
   3. use ``protopipe-BENCHMARK`` to check the performance of the generated models
   4. use ``protopipe-UPLOAD_MODELS`` to upload models and configuration file to your analysis directory on the DIRAC File Catalog

4. **Obtain training data for particle classification**

   1. edit ``grid.yaml`` to use gammas **with** energy estimation
   2. ``protopipe-SUBMIT_JOBS --analysis_path=[...]/test_analysis --output_type=TRAINING ....``
   3. once the jobs have concluded and the files are ready you can use ``protopipe-DOWNLOAD_AND_MERGE``
   4. repeat the first 3 points for protons
   5. use ``protopipe-BENCHMARK`` to check the quality of energy estimation on this data sample

5. **Build a model for particle classification**

   1. edit ``RandomForestClassifier.yaml``
   2. use ``protopipe-MODEL`` with this configuration file
   3. use ``protopipe-BENCHMARK`` to check the performance of the generated models
   4. use ``protopipe-UPLOAD_MODELS`` to upload models and configuration file to your analysis directory on the DIRAC File Catalog

6. **Get DL2 data**

   Execute points 1 and 2 for gammas, protons, and electrons separately.

   1. ``protopipe-SUBMIT_JOBS --analysis_path=[...]/test_analysis --output_type=DL2 ....``
   2. once the jobs have concluded and the files are ready you can use ``protopipe-DOWNLOAD_AND_MERGE``
   3. use ``protopipe-BENCHMARK`` to check the quality of the generated DL2 data

7. **Estimate the performance** (protopipe enviroment)

   1. edit ``performance.yaml``
   2. launch ``protopipe-DL3-EventDisplay`` with this configuration file
   3. use ``protopipe-BENCHMARK`` to check the quality of the generated DL3 data


Troubleshooting
---------------

Issues with the login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**After issuing the command ``dirac-proxy-init`` I get the message
"Your host clock seems to be off by more than a minute! Thats not good.
We'll generate the proxy but please fix your system time" (or similar)**

This can happen if you are working from a container.
Execute these commands:

- ``systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service``
- ``sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service``
- ``timedatectl``

Check that,

- ``System clock synchronized: yes``
- ``systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes``

**After issuing the command ``dirac-proxy-init`` and typing my certificate
password the process starts pending and gets stuck**

One possible reason might be related to your network security settings.
Some networks might require to add the option ``-L`` to ``dirac-proxy-init``.

Issues with the download
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**While downloading data I get "UTC Framework/API ERROR: Failures occurred during rm.getFile"**

Something went wrong during the download phase, either because of your network
connection (check for possible instabilities) or because of a problem
on the server side (in which case the solution is out of your control).

The recommended approach is to download data using ``protopipe-DOWNLOAD_AND_MERGE``.
This script enables by the default a backup download based on an ``rsync``-type command.

.. warning::

  There is a known bug in DIRAC at least on macos which does not allow to use this feature
  until a new release.

Issues with the job submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**I get an error like "Data too long for column 'JobName' at row 1" or similar**

The job name is too long, try to modify it temporarily by editing ``submit_jobs.py``,
in the source code of the interface.  
There will be soon an option to modify this at launch time.

**I get an error which starts with 'FileCatalog._getEligibleCatalogs: Failed to get file catalog configuration. Path /Resources/FileCatalogs does not exist or it's not a section'**

This is a Configuration System error which is not fully debugged yet.
Check that your dirac.cfg file is correctly edited.
In some cases the interface code will re-try to issue some commands in case this happens.
