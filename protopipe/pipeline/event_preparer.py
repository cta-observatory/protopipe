    2) preliminary image cleaning via simple tailcut with minimum number
       of core neighbours set at 1,
    3) only the biggest cluster of pixels ("main island") is kept.
    4) Parametrize following Hillas approach only if the resulting image has 3
       or more pixels (already in protopipe but after "real" image cleaning).
    5) Do a linear fit of pulse time vs. distance along major image axis (in
       CTA-MARS the ROOT "robust" fit option is used).
    6) For all pixels except the core ones in the preliminary image, integrate
       the waveform once more, in a fixed window of 5 samples set at the time
       "predicted" by the linear time fit.
       If the predicted time for a pixel leads to a window outside the readout
       window, then integrate also the last (or first) 5 samples.
    7) The result is an image with core pixels calibrated with a 1st pass and
       non-core pixels re-calibrated with a 2nd pass
