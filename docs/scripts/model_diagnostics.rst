Models diagnostics
==================

.. note::

  This script contitutes basically the benchmarks for the estimator models.
  As such it will be moved/translated in a DL2 benchmark notebook.

To get diagnostic plots in order to control the robustness and the performance
of the models you can use the script `model_diagnostic.py`. It takes as arguments
a configuration file:

.. code-block::

    usage: model_diagnostic.py [-h] --config_file CONFIG_FILE [--wave | --tail]

    Make diagnostic plot

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --config_file         CONFIG_FILE
      --wave                if set, use wavelet cleaning
      --tail                if set, use tail cleaning, otherwise wavelets

For the energy estimator the diagnostic plots consist in:

* Distribution of the features
* Importance of the features
* Distribution of the ratio of the reconstructed energy over the true energy
  fitted with a gaussian for the subarrays
* Energy resolution and energy bias corresponding to the gaussian parametrisation
  for the subarrays

For a g/h classifier the following diagnostic are provided:

* Distribution of the features
* Importance of the features
* ROC curve (and its variation with energy)
* Output model distribution (and its variation with energy)
