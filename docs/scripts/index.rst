Introduction
------------

This module contains the scripts that make up the pipeline operational sequence
explained in :ref:`usage`.

Each step of the analysis is explained in a dedicated section below.


Details
-------

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    data_training
    model_building
    model_diagnostics
    DL2
    optimization_cuts_IRFs

The tables created in the :ref:`data_training` and :ref:`DL2` steps are written
on disk in HDF5_ format using the PyTables_ Python module.
This choice has been done considering the potential huge
volume of data we will be dealing with in a near future.

.. note::

  Probably better to keep training and DL2 pages merged in one, since they
  share ``EventPreparer``.

Proposals for improvements and/or fixes
---------------------------------------

TO UPDATE

.. note::

  This section has to be moved to the repository as a set of issues.

* Features for regression and classification are hard-coded in the two scripts
  `write_dl1.py` and `write_dl2.py` **TO DO**
* The fields of the output tables do not follow any DL1 or DL2
  data format specified in the `gamma astro data format`_
  initiative **NEW FORMAT WITH NEXT RELEASE OF CTAPIPE**
