Workflow and usage
==================

.. toctree::

    use_pipeline
    use_grid

You should have at least a working installation of protopipe (:ref:`install`).

For full scale analyses, you will need also the GRID interface (:ref:`install-grid`).

After this you should,

 * get accustomed to the basic pipeline workflow (:ref:`use-pipeline`),
 * then make your own complete analysis (:ref:`use-grid`),

For bugs and new features, please contribute to the project (:ref:`contribute`).
